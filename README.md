# 🚀 CRUD User App: Your First Step into the MERN Stack!  

Welcome to my **CRUD User App**, a basic yet powerful MERN stack application! 🌟  
This project was my first dive into the world of MERN, helping me understand the magic of **Vanilla JS** vs. **React + Node.js**. It was an amazing learning journey, and now, it's your turn!  

Recreating it is not rocket science 🚀 — follow these simple steps, and you’ll have it running in no time. Let's get started!

### ⚠️ Prerequisites  
Before continuing, make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your system:  


- 👉 Download it here: [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org)  
- OR, if you're on a Unix-based OS, run this command in your terminal:  
```bash
sudo apt install nodejs npm 
```

Once you're ready, let the fun begin! 🎉
## 🛠️ How to Set It Up
-   ### Step 1️⃣: Clone the Repository:
    ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/Asadullah-byte/CRUD-user-app.git
      cd CRUD-user-app
    ```
-  ### Step 2️⃣: Install Dependencies
    Create a .env file in the root directory and add this configuration:
    ```bash
    npm install vite@latest
    npm install mongoose react axios
    ```
- ### Step 3️⃣: Set Up Environment Variables 🌐
    Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
    ```bash
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    PORT=5500
    ```
    🔑 Replace your_mongodb_connection_string with your actual MongoDB connection URI.
- ### Step 4️⃣: Run the Application 🏃‍♂️
    Start both the backend and frontend servers to bring your app to life:
    ```bash
        Start both the client and server using the following commands:
        
        # Start the server
        npm run server
        
        # Navigate to the client folder
        cd client
        
        # Start the React application
        npm run dev
    ```
- ### Step 5️⃣: Explore the App 🌍

    Once both servers are running, open your browser and visit:
    ```bash
    👉 http://localhost:3000
    ```
    🎉 Voilà! Your CRUD User App is live and ready to use.
